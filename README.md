This repository contains the code for a GitHub pages site for the publication [Object-Centric Diffusion for Efficient Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05735). The project page is hosted at https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/object-centric-diffusion/. 

This project showcases Object-Centric Diffusion, coined as OCD, to further reduce latency by allocating computations more towards foreground edited regions that are arguably more important for perceptual quality. We achieve this by two novel proposals: i) Object-Centric Sampling, decoupling the diffusion steps spent on salient regions or background, allocating most of the model capacity to the former, and ii) Object-Centric 3D Token Merging, which reduces cost of cross-frame attention by fusing redundant tokens in unimportant background regions. Both techniques are readily applicable to a given video editing model without retraining, and can drastically reduce its memory and computational cost.
